#+title: Markup Languages: Power of Plain Text

* What are markup languages?
According to Wikipedia:
#+begin_quote
Set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting...
#+end_quote
#+REVEAL: split
Markup languages allows you to focus more on the content instead of the design

Design can be delegated by a different process
#+begin_notes
Ask if they can name examples of markup languages
#+end_notes

* Popular markup languages
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Markdown
- HTML
- $\LaTeX$
- [[https://typst.app/][Typst]]

#+begin_notes
This slide is written with Org, but I don't recommend it since it's not usually outside of Emacs.
Ask if people have had to write their assignments in LaTeX or are taking classes for it
#+end_notes

* $\LaTeX$
+ High usage in Academia
+ Defacto standard for research documents as it looks professional
+ One of the most advanced math typsetting system

#+begin_notes
Ask if anyone has had to write LaTeX and their experience doing so
Show examples of documents you've created
#+end_notes
#+REVEAL: split
Try $\LaTeX$ [[https://latexbase.com/][here]]

#+begin_src tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb}
\begin{document}
  $2+2=6$
  $\int^5_12x+2\;dx$
\end{document}
#+end_src

Which produces the following:
\[
2+2=6 \\
\int^5_12x+2\;dx
\]


** Challenge
Imitate this
\[
\exists \; k \in \mathbb{Z} \ni b = ak
\]

** Documents you can create
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Resumes
+ Research papers
+ Thesis
+ Dreaded math tests

* Typst
A modern alternative to $\LaTeX$ that has a less steeper learning curve

#+begin_notes
Do a side by side comparison of a Typst document and a LaTeX one
Also show the source code of each to compare the syntax
#+end_notes

* Markdown

** Popular applications that use Markdown
+ Reddit
+ Obsidian
+ Discord
+ VsCode

** Reddit
Reddit has its own [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown/][flavor]] of Markdown

** Discord
Discord supports some markdown

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    return f"{self.process_id}\t\t{self.arrival_time}\t\t{self.burst_time}"

def __lt__(self, other):
    return self.burst_time < other.burst_time

def __hash__(self):
    return hash(self.__repr__())
```
