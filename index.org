#+title: Markup Languages: Power of Plain Text

* Requirements
Browser, internet connection
* What are markup languages?
According to Wikipedia:
#+begin_quote
Set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting...
#+end_quote
#+REVEAL: split
#+begin_src html
<h1>I am biggest text</h1>
<h2>I am medium text</h2>
<h3>I am smaller text</h3>
<p>I am smallest text</p>
#+end_src
#+begin_export html
<h1>I am biggest text</h1>
<h2>I am medium text</h2>
<h3>I am smaller text</h3>
<p>I am smallest text</p>
#+end_export
** Advantage of markup languages
+ Markup languages allows you to focus more on the content instead of the visual design
+ Separates the concern of visual and layout
+ Results in consistent layout

** Why do I use markup languages?
+ MS Word is painful to use
+ The ability to use different editors
+ It's text, so you can version control it
+ If a document requires a lot of technical details

** What I don't use markup languages for
+ Collaborating documents with others
+ Short documents that do not require much formatting

#+begin_notes
Ask if they can name examples of markup languages
#+end_notes

* Popular markup languages
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Markdown
- HTML
- $\LaTeX$
- [[https://typst.app/][Typst]]

#+begin_notes
This slide is written in Org, but it's not as popular, so I'm not going to take time to talk about it.
In case they're interested, plug https://github.com/curlyLasagna/Markup-Workshop
Ask if people have had to write their assignments in LaTeX or are taking classes for it
#+end_notes

* LaTeX
+ Loved by Academia
+ Defacto standard for research documents since it looks professional
+ Has one of the most advanced math typesetting system

#+begin_notes
Ask if anyone has had to write LaTeX and what their experience was in doing so
Typesetting is the formal process of standardizing text so that it's readable and legible
#+end_notes
#+REVEAL: split
Try $\LaTeX$ [[https://latexbase.com/][here]]

#+begin_src tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb}
\begin{document}
  $2+2=6$ is not correct\\
  $\int^5_12x+2\;dx$
\end{document}
#+end_src

#+begin_notes
Breakdown the different syntax of LaTeX
Disregard the boilerplate stuff
#+end_notes

The above document produces the following:
\[
2+2=6 \text{ is not correct} \\
\int^5_12x+2\;dx
\]

** Challenge
Generate this output
\[
\exists \; k \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } b = ak
\]

** Known uses
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Resumes
+ Research papers
+ Thesis
+ Textbooks
+ Dreaded math tests

** My resume written in LaTeX

* Typst
An attempt of creating a modern alternative to $\LaTeX$ that has a less steeper learning curve

Has great documentation

** Compared to LaTeX
Intuitive syntax
#+begin_src tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\begin{document}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item $\alpha$
      \item $1 - \alpha$
      \item $1-2\alpha$
      \item $2 - 2 \alpha$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{document}
#+end_src

#+begin_src C
#set enum(numbering: "(a)")
+ $alpha$
+ $1 - alpha$
+ $1 - 2 alpha$
+ $2 - 2 alpha$
#+end_src
#+REVEAL: split
Both outputs

** But..
Typst is still very young and doesn't have the same features as $\LaTeX$

You'll have to write your own functions that $\LaTeX$ would have as packages or wait for someone to make it

** Known uses
*Almost* anything you can make in $\LaTeX$, you can make in Typst

** Getting started with Typst
You can try Typst [[https://typst.app/][here]]

** Challenge
Write a function that prints your first name red and your last name green

* Markdown

#+begin_quote
"to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."

\- John Grubber
#+end_quote

** Popular applications that support Markdown
+ Reddit
+ Obsidian
+ Discord
+ VsCode
+ Microsoft Teams

** Endless possibilities
+ Websites
  + Jekyll
  + Hugo
+ Diagrams via Mermaid

Good for technical documentation
** Discord
Discord supports some markdown
#+begin_notes
Send this message on discord

# blah blah blah
```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    return f"{self.process_id}\t\t{self.arrival_time}\t\t{self.burst_time}"

def __lt__(self, other):
    return self.burst_time < other.burst_time

def __hash__(self):
    return hash(self.__repr__())
```

** LaTeX in Markdown??
Some markdown processors include a math mode for you to render equations using $\LaTeX$

Obsidian supports $\LaTeX$ rendering out of the box
